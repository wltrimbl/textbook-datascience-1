    "Python offers a number of different data types that can be manipulated and used by various functions. Some important built-in Python data types include **booleans**, **strings**, **integers**, and **floats**. These data types can be used to build various data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, arrays, and dataframes, which will be covered in Chapters [4](../../04/DataStructures.ipynb) and [6](../../06/DataFrames.ipynb). Here we will explore each data type and corresponding functions that are useful when working with these data types."

    "## Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "Booleans are a data type that consist of two possible outcomes: `True` or `False`. Under the hood, these values take on a binary value, where `True` is equal to 1 and `False` is equal to 0. Booleans are very commonly used with comparison operators (discussed more in [Section 3.4](../../03/4/Comparison.ipynb)), and because they also can have a numeric meaning, they can be used in calculations as well. Let's start with a simple example of a Boolean."
