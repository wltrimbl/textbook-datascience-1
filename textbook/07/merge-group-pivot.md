# DataFrame Methods and Operations

*Susanna Lange*

Continuing our investigation of pandas and DataFrames, in this chapter we explore useful operations and methods that allow us to apply functions to DataFrames, combine data from multiple sources as well as to view and sort data based on desired characteristics. This chapter focuses on the `apply`, `merge`, `groupby`, and `pivot_table` methods of DataFrames.
